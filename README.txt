A small project created by Ranjan Bhat.

Q.1: What is it?
Ans: A simulation of the infamous 3-body gravitational problem. It has no analytical solution yet and can only be numerically modelled, which is exactly what I have done here.

Q.2: What are the features available?
Ans:
- Can change any/all of the initial conditions of the system
- Can change colours of objects/orbits
- Can move around camera in 3-D
- The program will centre the system so that the COM remains fixed at the origin at all times
- (And to please the Physicists who will read this, I have promptly set G=1)

Q.3: How can I change the initial conditions and colours?
Ans: Theres a file in the data folder named 'constants.txt', you can alter the constants there.

Q.4: How can I change the camera angle?
Ans: Arrow keys.

Q.5: How do I exit?
Ans: Esc.

Q.6: Why did you make this?
Ans: Why not? It's fun.

Q.7: What can I use this for?
Ans: It could be a nice little screensaver if you'd like :)

Q.8: How long did you take to make this?
Ans: From inspiration to completion, about 18hrs.

Q.9: Anything else?
Ans: Yes, if anyone who uses this gets some very beautifully evolving systems while playing around with the inital state, please do share it with me. Also, for all those who want to put in strange numbers and break the simulation, have at it. I have also not added collision as part of the simulation, so if the bodies get too close to each other the force will become NaN and will cause a runtime error.
